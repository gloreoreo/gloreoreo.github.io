                        ShopNavi is an application in response to a sponsored project with Juno Lighting, LLC in Des Plaines, IL. I had interpreted the project as an opportunity to explore solutions using futuristic yet achievable lighting arrangements. ShopNavi is a store navigation system that may assist users, whether they are shy about asking for directions or are new to an area, towards their store section or product that they are searching for.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Goals</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                My goal as the designer of ShopNavi was to not "hold the hand" of the user to the product, but to give them a push in the right direction. The average store is well-organized in terms of related products in a section, and didn't want the user to lose the skill of associating certain products with the correct section, i.e. milk to dairy section, and apples to the fruits section of the produce aisle. I also wanted to avoid lighting solutions that involved any blinking lights in avoidance of visual noise and minimizing seizure risk in the epileptic population, or lights and colors that'd exclude users who were colorblind or give a colorblind option.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Storyboard</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                This is a one-paneled storyboard. Attaching the concept of the product to the human element is crucial for me to create first iterations of a product.  My original intention was for the user to only use their phone to briefly point them in the right direction, and stow it away. This stage in the design process is the perfect stage to illustrate concepts now, and sweating about the fine details later in the process.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Market Research</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Market research is an important part of the design process, because it lets you learn about trends and traits that do and don't recieve positive feedback from the user, and may inspire or push the designer to find more creative solutions. After scanning numerous reviews and articles, this information is what I've found about two existing products, ByteLight and a smartwatch solution to grocery store navigation.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Prototype</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Using gathered information and input from those in similar situations to my established persona and target audience, I created a rough drawing of the first prototype.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                After signing up and logging in, you can always stay logged in and find the stores you frequent, along with finding nearby grocery stores. At this stage, I had started chatting with marketing and business colleagues who had found it a prime concept to allow hosting and advertising of store and manufacturing coupons to help fund the existence of the application as a whole.

                Although short and simple, the ShopNavi application had captured the attention of Juno Lighting, LLC as a possible step into the future with lighting in IoT.
