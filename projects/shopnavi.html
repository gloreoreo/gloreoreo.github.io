            <p class="project-paragraph">
                You had just moved far, far away from home, or are having a long-term visit in a country very foreign to you. Instead of eating out everyday, you say, "Hey, why not visit a grocery store and try to make something for myself?" You enter the nearest chain grocery store you can find, then realize you're too shy with your current foreign language skills, or are just too shy in general to ask where certain ingredients are.
                So. You're shy, nervous, and quite a bit anxious about messing up your words when asking a local where certain ingredients are. What can we do to help?
            </p>

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">So, what's the problem here?</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                What if there was something to help point you in the right direction without the need for human assistance? How can we use the lighting options offered by Juno Lighting, LLC in a new, creative, and futuristic way?

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                This image is a sketch out of many that I had done to document the vision I had been seeing as possible solutions to the problem I had in mind. In essence, this is a storyboard. I use storyboards to connect the concept of the product to the human element, along with establishing a persona and a target audience. I generally draw storyboards for more futuristic products, and enjoy seeing not only the product, but the product in the hands of a perspective user.  My original intention was for the user to only use their phone to briefly point them in the right direction, and stow it away after being pointed in the right direction.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Market research is an important part of the design process, because it lets you learn about trends and traits that do and don't recieve positive feedback from the user, and may inspire or push the designer to find more creative solutions. After scanning numerous reviews and articles, this information is what I've found about two existing products, ByteLight and a smartwatch solution to grocery store navigation.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                I had called up a couple of friends and family that fit the target persona to provide feedback on this concept. Here are just a few of the responses I got from my survey group.

                What's incredibly interesting is that one person, KW, had brought up possibly bringing those mail-in advertisements and coupons to the application, and be able to subscribe to them through the application. This came to be very valuable in creating another way for the application to support itself as a business function. I was also graced with passionate stories from international students and workers about how this would've been very helpful to them for their adjustment phase, where they also combatted homesickness and being self-conscious about their accents. Seeing an opportunity for helping our target user, it was time to start ideation.

                Using gathered information and input from those in similar situations to my established persona and target audience, as well as applying UX trends and data collected from market research, I created a rough drawing of a couple of main screens.

                 After inquiring for further feedback from a Business in Design professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I was able to draft up a rough structure of how the product would fund itself.

                Stores could install small nodes at varying parts of their store, and in exchange for their efforts, they will be able to advertise and offer coupons in an effective way through ShopNavi, for a small fee. In the end, the users get to see all deals and services near them, and be able to locate the section of the store they need to go to in order to find their groceries quickly, without much human interference. This will also allow the users to slowly learn their environment at their own pace.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Low-Fidelity Wireframe</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                After signing up and logging in, you can always stay logged in and find the stores you frequent, along with finding nearby grocery stores. This is normally where the designer begins to become more involved with collaborating with the developer to assure certain functions are possible.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                This stage is a soft-finalization of the UI/UX direction of the application. I was beginning to lean towards the colors blue and green. Blue because it is generally a calming color, and blue and green being reflective of fresh, gentle, and clean nature. I wanted to have a simple base for the color scheme so it'd be easier to add multi-colored advertisements or coupon books to the application.

                Of course, due to the project's consulting nature I wasn't able to participate in the prototype testing which happened in the hands of Juno Lighting, LLC.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                There were a lot of processes I had wished to dive into. I had wanted to test if the compass would've been a good choice for pointing someone in a direction, or any other method. I had wanted to test if, perhaps, I should let the application sense where the user was and, if the application was pulled out at the store, go straight to pulling up the compass. I had also wanted to explore how and if the interface would change if it sensed you were or weren't in a store, and wanted to see deals located at another store. After the final delivery, the project was put into the hands of another Juno Lighting professional.
