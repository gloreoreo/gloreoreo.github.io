                        GoldenGate was a collaborative project focused on creating a new, efficient entry solution for secured parking facilities i.e. corporate campus, paid parking lots and residential parking. The goal was to create an experience "as smooth as butter" from securing a parking spot, setting up a residential area as an administrator, from entering the secured area, to parking, all while creating a cost-efficient solution for the land-owner.

                Storyboards help me connect concepts of a solution to the human element. This storyboard depicts one of the old solutions to reality. You can see how originally we had entertained the idea of a pin off a module notification as a solution to the problem.

                We all had gone to Chicago to test out the existing parking garages, and the current SpotHero experience. Due to the faces of my colleagues being shown in the documentation, I have left out the images for their privacy.

                Here are but few of the sketches I had done to try to organize my thoughts on the problem given. Shortly after, I had collaborated with the computer and electrical engineer on how this system would work.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                After collaborating, we had decided on a system where the retrofit, application, and the web portal would all connect and communicate data using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The mobile application will sense the retrofit device within a certain range and prompt a module to confirm entry, while, if applicable, the administrator would use the web portal to register a user into the system and manage permissions.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                I had designed the screens for the web portal experience, available for business and residential areas. Based off of the data organization stage, creating screens after having established a means of organization made the design process much more efficient.
