                        Individual Project
                        <br> <br>
                        Trackit is a conceptual application that is a universal package tracking utensil, designed with small businesses in mind. I had focused heavily on usability, which decisions were influenced by usability testing, along with data gathered during market research. This application was primarily designed for Android devices in end of 2016.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">What's the issue here?</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Imagine you're a small business owner or someone with a really complex hobby, like building custom mechanical keyboards. There are numerous shipping services involved, be it FedEx, USPS, UPS, Amazon, and much more, especially if it's done internationally. You have trouble and frankly are frustrated with how many different sites you have to keep open on your computer, or oddball mobile applicatitons on your phone, just to check if your supplies or products are making good time to you or your customers. If only there was a way to keep track of all that in one spot.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Goal</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                To create a hub for a user to keep track of all outgoing and incoming packages.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Market Research</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                To explore these questions, I had then conducted market research on existing products, like Fedex package tracking and Microsoft Delivery Beta. I had analyzed the UI and design decisions they had made and the effect it had on their consumers. Quotes featured are but few of the reviews I had encountered.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Establishing a Persona</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                I wanted to create Trackit with my mother's small business in mind. As a seamstress, she has to track dates and times that certain materials are coming to our home. I had created Audrey as my persona to fit that sort of creative small business owner who works with many different types of materials, and ships out different products. I wanted to keep Trackit humble and inexclusive. Establishing a persona will help me stay focused on the end-user when designing.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Mindmapping</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                After loading my brain with newfound information through market research and brainstorming around an established persona, I throw down all ideas and thoughts into a mindmap. I begin to entertain different user experience solutions, from visualizing the feeling of progression in shipment, to colors, to organization within the application in terms of packages, incoming and outgoing. This internal debate on paper will help me keep note of different options I could adopt and test in User testing stages, and potentially inspire a new direction if a solution isn't working.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Research to Design</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Using current UI/UX trend knowledge and results from the market research and reviews, I had sketched out a couple of screens for Trackit. You can see there's still a lot of work to be done, as I've marked thoughts, critiques, and concerns in red, as well as possible interaction animations and directions.

            <hr>
            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Final Thoughts</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Because Trackit was in response to a Design Challenge, I had only done one low-fidelity prototype of two screens of the application, applying the information that I had gathered to the screens. Although small, I became rather proud of this project because it was the first time I had experimented with applying my Industrial Design expertise into UX design, and launched my career and growing interest into UX and Product Design. It also showcases a belief of mine, that research and user-testing are essential steps in a strong design process.
                <br> <br>
                If I could do more, I would've definitely ran user testing on how people would feel about the different visual progression methods I was entertaining, and would have designed an experience that was more in-depth about explaining how the process of tracking certain packages worked.
