                        Trackit is a conceptual application that is a universal package tracking utensil, designed with small businesses in mind. I had focused heavily on usability, which decisions were influenced by usability testing, along with data gathered during market research. This application was primarily designed for android in end of 2016.

            <p class="project-paragraph">
                I began the design process by throwing my thoughts onto paper by mindmapping any problems, ideas, concerns and questions to address. I had also worked out potential UIUX directions, including list and icon organization, and ways to display progress of a package en route.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Market Research</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                To explore these questions, I had then conducted market research on existing products, like Fedex package tracking, and Microsoft Delivery Beta. I had analyzed the UI and design decisions they had made, and the effect it had on their consumers. Quotes featured are but few of the reviews I had encountered.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Research to Design</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                After conducting user and market research, I had began to make design decisions in terms of layout, progression, and notification methods.

            <h4 class="project-subtitle">Final Thoughts</h4>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                Due to the experimental nature of the project, I had only done one low-fidelity prototype of two screens of the application, applying the information that I had gathered to the screens. Although small, I became rather proud of this project because it was the first time I had experimented with applying my Industrial Design expertise into UX design, and launched my career and growing interest into UX and Product Design. It also showcases a belief of mine, that research and user-testing are essential steps in a strong design process.
